# AppSync for me

### Getting started

###### This is for me to remember where the good stuff is.

### Finding the Community


###### AWS Documentation is just ok. In my experience they leave out quite a lot which is where there are a handful of dev blogs to fill in that knowlege vacuum. Below are some great links I've come accross. 

[Casual Reading on AppSync experience](https://medium.com/@dadc/aws-appsync-the-unexpected-a430ff7180a3) Before you start.

* [Amplify Gitter](https://gitter.im/AWS-Amplify/Lobby) is a chat lobby for the amplify community. I'm honestly not to involved in it because I forget about it.
*  [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-amplify) Because stackoverflow is always there for you.

* [Nadir is amazing](https://medium.com/@dabit3) Sure, he's an amazon employee, so he basically being paid to make it look easy, but wow this is a good place to start reading and following along in tutorials
