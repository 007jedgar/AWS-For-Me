* [Amplify Gitter](https://gitter.im/AWS-Amplify/Lobby) is a chat lobby for the amplify community. I'm honestly not to involved in it because I forget about it.
*  [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-amplify) Because stackoverflow is always there for you.

* [Nadir is amazing](https://medium.com/@dabit3) Sure, he's an amazon employee, so he basically being paid to make it look easy, but wow this is a good place to start reading and following along in tutorials
